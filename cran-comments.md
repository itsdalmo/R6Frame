## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Completed the "introduction" vignette.

* Added minimal example for R6Frame (previous was NULL).

* Removed examples for dcast and melt, instead linking to data.table documentation
  under seealso.
  
* Removed examples for rbind and cbind, instead linking to base:: documentation
  under seealso.




## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.0
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
